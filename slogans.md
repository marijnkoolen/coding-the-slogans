### Digital Environment for Learning and Research

+ Convention over Configuration
+ Training over Support
+ Collaboration over Ownership
+ Best Practices over Standards
+ Experimentation over Reproduction

--

### 1. Convention over Configuration

+ preferred, state of the art, technology stack
  + Node
  + Express
  + MongoDB
  + AngularJS
+ majority of problems can be addressed with this stack
+ deviations from this stack are possible on individual basis
+ Training can be developed specifically for this stack
+ Shared stack allows focus on research rather than technology
+ Shared stack enables specialized support
+ Shared stack actively encourages sharing
  + tools 
  + (best) practices 
  + data sets

--

### 2. Training over Support

+ support addresses a problem once, training removes the problem
+ researchers/students become more autonomous
+ researchers/students take ownership of their tools
+ support can be utilized where it is most needed (see also point 1)
  + absolute beginners
  + advanced users
  + edge cases

--

### 3. Collaboration over Ownership

+ restricting access to tools and data hampers visibility and impact
+ collaboration is one of the great strengths of digital research
+ digital environments facilitate collaboration
+ divide labor through different tasks and skill sets
+ aid learning through peer feedback and group projects
+ open source ideal for international collaboration
+ platform grows through individual contributions
+ Version Control (Git)
  + encourages sharing, re-use, modification
  + guides versioning of large collaborative projects

--

### 4. Best Practices over Standards

+ Best practices are dynamic and adaptive
+ Best practices are important for (future) employers
+ Best practices allow collaboration
+ Best practices encourage maintainability
+ Best practices enable discussion 
+ Best practices can be shared/taught

--

### 5. Experimentation over Reproduction 

+ humanists should own (= create) their tools
+ prefabricated tools often inappropriate and lead to tunnel vision
+ modifying tools creates new insights and research questions
